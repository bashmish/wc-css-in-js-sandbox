# web-components-playground

This is my playground to experiment with Web Components and related technologies in search for the best way to develop a library of reusable, framework-agnostic, high-performant, accessible and maintainable components.

To run the server:

```sh
npm i -g polymer-cli
npm run build-vendor
polymer serve
```
